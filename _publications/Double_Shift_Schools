title: "Quantifying School Value Added in Double Shift Schooling"
collection: publications
type: work
excerpt: 'Using individual-level panel data on test scores to control for student heterogeneity, I estimate the effects of afternoon school value added. I find that, on average, children attending the afternoon shift perform 5.7\% and 6.6\% standard deviations higher in their verbal and math test scores, respectively, compared to if they attended the morning session. The results are mainly driven by students in the lower quartile of the distribution who enroll in afternoon schools.'
