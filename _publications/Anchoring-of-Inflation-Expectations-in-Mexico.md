excerpt: 'This study analyzes short, medium and long run inflation expectations anchorage among professional forecasters from the private sector in Mexico before and after the financial crisis of 2008 by introducing a novel classification that catalogs to a large extent the econometric efforts that have been made for its measurement. The three dimensions covered by this classification are sensitivity, resilience and credibility. The results show that for the period evaluated after the 2008 financial crisis and as the horizon for which inflation forecasts are made increases, expectations are better anchored.'
