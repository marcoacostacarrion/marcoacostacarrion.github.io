The aim of this course is to analyze firm behavior in imperfectly competitive markets, using economic theory and game theory to understand strategies, market outcomes, and public policy responses.

Course Objective:
==

1. Study firm behavior in settings where perfect competition does not hold.
2. Analyze the pricing and marketing strategies firms use to increase profits.
3. Examine the effects of interactions between firms, including the risks of anti-competitive coordination.
4. Evaluate public policy responses to firm behavior, focusing on antitrust laws and regulation.
5. Apply consumer and producer theory, with emphasis on game theory, to understand firm strategy.
6. Connect theoretical and empirical tools to real-world issues in markets, providing foundations for careers in consulting, finance, law, and public policy.
