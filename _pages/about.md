I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [Indiana University](https://bloomington.iu.edu/index.html). I study how education policies shape effort, school value-added, and welfare, using applied microeconomics and industrial organization tools. My job market paper measures the effect of elite-school eligibility on student effort in Mexico City’s centralized assignment system. 


Prior to graduate school, I worked at the [Central Bank of Mexico](https://www.banxico.org.mx) conducting research payment systems and inflation. I earned a Master of Public Administration and a Master of Science at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), and received my Bachelor’s degree in Economics from [ITESM](https://tec.mx/).
