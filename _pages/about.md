I am a PhD candidate in Economics at [Indiana University](https://economics.indiana.edu). I study how education policies shape effort, school value-added, and welfare, using apply microeconomics and industrial organization tools. My job market paper measures the effect of elite-school eligibility on student effort in Mexico City’s centralized assignment system. Previously, I worked at the [Central Bank of Mexico](https://www.banxico.org.mx) on inflation and labor markets analysis.
